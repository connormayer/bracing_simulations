# Tongue bracing simulations

This repository contains the results and analysis for Study 3 in Liu et al. (resubmitted). The repoistory is structured as follows:
* The `src` folder contains the script used to analyze the simulation results.
* The `data` folder contains the simulation data. There is data from five runs. Runs 3 and 5 were used in the paper, and correspond to the 5mm and 10mm conditions respectively. The analysis script contains comments that describe the format of the data for each simulation.
* The `images` folder contains several figures used in the paper.
